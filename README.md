# Generics in Go

An example of a function calculating smaller of two numbers.

First it was implemented in terms of non-generic types,
then Golang's generic types were used to learn how they work and test limitations.

## Installation

1. Install Go using package manager or following the instructions at https://golang.org/doc/install

2. Install `ginkgo` and `gomega`:

```shell
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...
```

## Usage

1. Run the tests:

```shell
ginkgo -r -v
```

2. Read the tests and implementation to dive deeper.

3. Experiment with the code.
